# Ethio-Cyber-Shield (ECS) — Support Model & Operational Boundaries

> **Document Version**: 3.0  
> **Mandate**: Clearly delineate operational responsibilities, support service levels, and boundaries of assistance across platform editions.  
> **Adherence to Principle #6**: Ethio-Cyber-Shield explicitly disclaims guaranteed compliance or 24/7 outsourced SOC protection unless formally contracted under a dedicated Managed Defense SLA.

## 2. Severity Classification & Incident Response SLAs

Severity levels apply to software defects, platform outages, and incident response assistance:

### Severity 1 — Critical Platform Outage or Active National Breach
- **Definition**: Core detection engine stopped; durable event ingestion failure; active high-impact ransomware or massive P2P mule cascade requiring emergency intervention.
- **Pro Target Response**: $\le$ 2 hours (during business hours).
- **Managed Target Response**: $\le$ 30 minutes (24/7/365).
- **Escalation Path**: Primary Responder $\to$ Platform Operations Lead $\to$ CISO / Designated Authority.

### Severity 2 — Significant Degradation
- **Definition**: Notification channels impaired; secondary connector failures; rate-limit throttling in non-critical pipeline.
- **Pro Target Response**: $\le$ 6 hours.
- **Managed Target Response**: $\le$ 2 hours.

### Severity 3 — General Technical Query or Minor Anomaly
- **Definition**: Rule tuning guidance; false positive adjustment request; documentation clarification.
- **Pro Target Response**: Next business day.
- **Managed Target Response**: $\le$ 8 hours.

## 3. Explicit Boundaries & Disclaimers

### 3.1 No Automatic 24/7 SOC Coverage
Deploying Ethio-Cyber-Shield Community or Pro Edition provides the technical infrastructure, detection logic, and automation guardrails, but **does not constitute an external 24/7 outsourced Security Operations Center (SOC)**. Internal security analysts or a contracted Managed Defense team must monitor alerts, execute manual approvals, and interface with law enforcement.

### 3.2 Regulatory Compliance Disclaimers
In accordance with Rule #6 of our Core Engineering Guidelines:
> **Ethio-Cyber-Shield provides tools that *"supports evidence for"* statutory compliance and incident readiness. It does not *"guarantee"* compliance with INSA Proclamation No. 1426/2026, NBE Directives, or PDPP Proclamation No. 1321/2024.**

Final compliance determinations, regulatory filings, and legal defenses remain the sole statutory responsibility of the operator's designated Data Protection Officer (DPO) and Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).

### 3.3 Safe Automation Boundaries
In `auto` mode, Ethio-Cyber-Shield executes predefined, bounded mitigation actions (e.g., temporary account quarantine, session revocation). Operators remain responsible for maintaining allowlists, configuring emergency kill switches, and reviewing automated action logs.
